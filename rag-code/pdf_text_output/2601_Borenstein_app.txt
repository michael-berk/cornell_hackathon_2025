Calculation of subsidies for fossil fuels
The paper states that “Adeyeye et. al. (2009) estimate that total subsidies for fossil fuels
from 2002-2008 were $72 billion in the United States, of which about $21 billion plausibly
went to domestically produced coal and natural gas that went into electricity production.”
Based on the descriptions on page 7-16 of Adeyeye et. al. (2009), this includes all of the
categories that are primarily subsidizing coal: Credit for Production of Nonconventional
Fuels ($14.1b), Black Lung Disability Trust Fund ($1.0b), Characterizing Coal Royalty
Payments as Capital Gains ($1.0b), Exclusion of Beneﬁt Payments to Disabled Miners
($0.4b), Other-Fuel Exploration & Development Expensing ($0.3b), Other-Fuel Excess of
Percentage over Cost Depletion ($0.3b), Special Rules for Mining Reclamation Reserves
($0.2b), Natural Gas Distribution Lines Treated as Fifteen-Year Modiﬁed Accelerated Cost
Recovery System (MACRS) Property ($0.1b), Expensing Advanced Mine Safety Equip-
ment ($0.03b). In addition, for a number of oil and natural gas items, I’ve prorated for the
value of natural gas used in electricity generation as a share of all oil and gas production
in the U.S., which average about 16% over this period. This percentage is applied to Oil
and Gas Exploration & Development Expensing ($7.1b), Oil and Gas Excess Percentage
over Cost Depletion ($5.4b), Exception from Passive Loss Limitations for Oil and Gas
($0.2b). I also include in this category Reduced Government Take from Federal Oil and
Gas Leasing ($7.0b), which is charging below-market rates for leases. These are arguably
subsidies, but they are actually unlikely to be passed through to prices for natural gas. I do
not include the Foreign Tax Credits, which could be subsidies, but are extremely unlikely
to aﬀect domestic prices for natural gas or coal.

Calculation of Levelized Cost for Residential Solar Photovoltaic Power
This is an extended version of the published section on levelized cost of residential solar
PV, including citations for assumptions and discussion of some issues in more detail.
In this section, I apply the analytic approach described above to update the calculations
of levelized cost of residential solar power from Borenstein (2008a), taking into account
recent changes in the cost of solar photovoltaic systems.
According to Barbose et al (2011), residential-scale solar systems (less than 10 kilowatt
capacity) in 2010 varied in average price from $6.3/watt in New Hampshire to $8.4/watt
in Utah, with California – by far the largest state for residential solar – at $7.30. Taking
California’s number as the benchmark, Table 2 presents the implied levelized cost of power
for a 5 kilowatt system located in Sacramento, California, under alternative real discount
rates. The underlying assumptions, noted in the table, are intended to be median estimates,
if anything tilted somewhat towards a lower cost of solar power.
The real interest rate of 3 percent implies a levelized cost of $0.315 per kilowatt-hour.
I follow Borenstein (2008a) in adjusting for the timing of production, increasing the value
of residential solar by 20 percent, which is slightly higher than the estimated gains of 15%-
17% in a typical grid operation (with generation reserves) for Southwest facing panels in
Sacramento, but lower than the 40%-50% premium in an “ideal” economic grid with no
generation reserves and prices clearing the market hour by hour. I adjust for the location
of production, increasing value by just 1 percent as found in Borenstein (2008a), because
residential solar panels are not disproportionately located in congested areas. These eﬀects
are incorporated by adjusting the levelized cost down to $0.260 per kilowatt-hour (=
0.315
1.2·1.01).
An additional downward adjustment of $0.02 per kilowatt-hour accounts for
long-run savings in transmission investment, as discussed in Borenstein (2008b, p. 10),
which brings the net cost to $0.240.1 This compares to levelized costs for combined-cycle
gas-ﬁred generation that are now generally below $0.08 per kilowatt-hour given recent price
forecasts for natural gas that account for supply increases from new production techniques.
Adjusting next for environmental externalities raises the issues discussed earlier about
the cost of those externalities. If one assumes that new residential solar generation substi-
tutes for new combined-cycle gas turbines, then the local pollutant reduction is valued at
1 Even the ﬁgure $0.02 per kilowatt-hour is above the average transmission cost per kilowatt-hour in most
U.S. utilities including California.

Assumptions: Five kilowatt system costs $36,500 installed (California estimate for 2010 from Barbaose et
al (2011, p. 21)). Panels last for 30 years with no shading or soiling and no maintenance costs, producing
on average 0.77 kilowatts over all hours in ﬁrst year (based on Sharp corporation calculator for SSW
facing panels in Sacramento, California (http://sharpusa.cleanpowerestimator.com/default.aspx). Output
of panels declines by 0.5% per year due to degradation (Barbose et al (2011, p. 47)). Inverter replaced
after 10 (at $2552) and 20 (at $2171) years, based on current cost of $3000 (Barbose et al (2011, p. 16))
declining by 2% annually in real terms (Borenstein (2008a) and cites therein).
about $0.0015 per kilowatt-hour according to Muller, Mendelsohn and Nordhaus (2011).
That leaves a cost gap between residential solar and combined-cycle gas turbine generation
of at least $0.158. The gas plant emits slightly less than 0.0005 tons of carbon dioxide per
kilowatt-hour of electricity, so residential solar would be cost competitive on a social cost
basis only if the cost of carbon dioxide emissions were greater than $316 per ton. Nearly
all social cost and price forecasts for carbon dioxide are well below $100 per ton (Green-
stone, Kopits and Wolverton, 2011), which leaves residential solar still at least $0.108 per
kilowatt-hour more expensive.
This analysis is for the cost of installation in 2010. Barbose et al (2011) report prelim-
inary data suggesting that costs for systems below 10 kilowatts fell $0.5 per kilowatt in
the ﬁrst half of 2011, but they don’t report details for California. Nonetheless, this high-
lights the fact that such cost analyses are in constant ﬂux as technology improves and as
supply/demand factors change. It’s also important to note that I have used the retail cost
of installation (before subsidies) to represent the social cost of photovoltaics. Depending
on the degree of capacity utilization, exercise of market power and the supply/demand
balance in the equipment and installation markets, retail price may be above or below
long-run marginal cost of production and distribution of a given technology.
This analysis does not account for distribution cost savings from distributed generation
or for spillovers from learning-by-doing, for which analyses oﬀer much less guidance. On
the other side, it also doesn’t incorporate reduced output due to shading or soiling of the
panels, or installation at a less-than-ideal angle due to the building orientation, as discussed
in Borenstein (2008b). Nor does it account for the cost of extra generation reserves to
backup intermittent generation. In addition, it does not incorporate the expected returns
to waiting and the option value of waiting: if cost declines are expected to occur for
exogenous reasons, then installing solar in the future could have a higher social net present
3

value that installing today. In addition, to the extent there is uncertainty about the rate
of cost declines – in solar and in alternatives to solar – then waiting retains the option
to pursue a diﬀerent technology for a given project if it turns out to be less expensive.
Nonetheless, this analysis does give a good notion of the gap that those omitted factors
would have to ﬁll on net in order for residential solar photovoltaics to cost-eﬀectively
substitute for gas-ﬁred generation.
Medium-scale and large-scale solar photovoltaics installations and large-scale solar ther-
mal generation are more cost competitive.
Contracts for these larger systems are not
public, but reports in the industry press suggest the unsubsidized levelized cost from these
installations is probably between $0.15 and $0.20 per kilowatt-hour in 2011, before any of
the market or externality adjustments, and likely using more than a 3% real cost of capital.
These systems enjoy the same production timing beneﬁt as residential solar, but less (or
none) of the reduction in line losses and transmission savings. These systems would require
a much lower cost of carbon dioxide to be competitive with gas-ﬁred generation, though
still probably $100 per ton or greater.
